In this project, I've tried doing a descriptive analysis. <br/>
The dataset I've used is a reduced verion of contoso data set used by Microsoft for training purposes.

### Quick Summary<br/>
This project was aimed to get familiar with Microsoft Power BI and to achieve that, I did a descriptive analysis.
You can download the original dataset, by [clicking here][1]<br/>

The dataset is about a company named "Contoso", which is struggling with its declining sales.<br/>
The company offers ultiples products in multiple continents. They have 4 types of channels which are Online, Reseller, Catalog, Store.


### Prerequisites
* [Contoso Dataset][1]
* [Microsoft Power BI][2]


### Findings

I analysed the data with the helps of plots and charts. You can view my workspace downloading this project. <br/>
My major findings included:
* Company's declining sales in North America, which also acted its major market
* The company sales have been reducing in its offline stores while slowly increased via online channels. However, stores still remain the most revenues generating channel.
* A major portion of Contoso's revenue comes from its sales of Computers.
* The YoY sales tell that 2012 was an exceptionally bad year for Contoso in North America and Europe. 

and some other similar findings.

Up next, I used the "Forecast" feature of PowerBI to predict the seasonality effects on Contoso's sales as represented in the "Seasonality & Predictions" sheet of the workspace.
